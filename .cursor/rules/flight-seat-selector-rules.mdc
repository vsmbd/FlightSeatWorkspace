# Overview

This project is a model-first system, not a UI-first application.

Core constraints:
- Seat layout must be deterministic and geometry-accurate.
- Data models define spatial truth; rendering must not encode business logic.
- Experience attributes (e.g., noise, obstruction, proximity) are metadata layers, not UI hacks.
- Predictable performance is preferred over visual cleverness.
- Avoid unnecessary allocations, layout thrashing, or hidden state.

Design expectations:
- Separate data modeling, layout computation, and rendering concerns.
- Favor extensibility across aircraft types over one-off solutions.
- Make performance and memory implications explicit when proposing solutions.

Do not assume airline branding, pricing, booking flows, or product-specific UI conventions.
